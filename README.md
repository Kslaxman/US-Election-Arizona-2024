## Results and Insights

### 1. 🏛️ Presedential race Prediction - AZ - 07

| Metric | Training Data (Historical) | Model Prediction (2024) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Winner** | Democrat | **Democrat** |
| **Precincts Won** | 1,065 / 1,494 | 267 / 299 |
| **Win Percentage** | 71.29% | **89.30%** |

> for the 2024 presidential race, with an even stronger margin (~89%) than the
> historical baseline (~71%)

### 2. 🏠 Congressional House Representative Prediction

| Field | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **Predicted Winner** | **Raul Grijalva** (Democrat) |
| **Incumbency** | Incumbent (long-serving representative of AZ-07) |

The model was trained on historical candidate data including vote counts and
incumbency status. After encoding candidates and scaling features using
imputation and standardization pipelines, the **Random Forest classifier**
predicted **Raul Grijalva** as the winning candidate.

The precinct-level choropleth map of the 2022 AZ-07 congressional race
confirmed overwhelming **blue (Democrat)** dominance across the district,
with Republican wins limited to sparse rural precincts.

### 3. 🗳️ Voter Turnout Prediction

Across the three major counties of AZ-07 (Pima, Maricopa, Yuma)

**County-Level Breakdown (Gradient Boosting):**

| County | Predicted Ballots | Eligible Voters | Turnout % |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Pima | 354,640 | 637,671 | **55.61%** |
| Maricopa | 1,562,866 | 2,357,115 | **66.30%** |
| Yuma | 55,716 | 93,988 | **59.28%** |
| **Total** | **1,973,222** | **3,088,774** | **63.88%** |

> **Key Takeaway:** Maricopa County drives the highest absolute turnout due to
> population size, while Yuma County shows moderate engagement (~59%), likely
> influenced by its rural character and demographic composition.

### 4. 🔍 Key Factors Influencing Voter Preferences

The R-based demographic and socioeconomic analysis revealed several critical
factors that shape voter behavior in AZ-07:

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Racial & Ethnic Composition

| County | Dominant Race | Percentage |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Maricopa | White | 53.25% |
| Pima | White | 50.05% |
| **Yuma** | **Hispanic** | **65.26%** |

> Yuma County's **supermajority Hispanic population** (65.26%) is a defining
> characteristic of AZ-07. This demographic heavily influences the district's
> lean toward Democratic candidates and elevates **immigration, border policy,
> and bilingual services** as top electoral issues.

#### 💰 Median Household Income

The ACS data comparison of U.S.–Mexico border states reveals Arizona's
relative economic position:

| State | Median Household Income |
|-------|------------------------|
| California | Highest among border states |
| Texas | Mid-range |
| **Arizona** | **Below California & Texas** |
| New Mexico | Lowest among border states |

> Within AZ-07, **Yuma County has the lowest median income**, correlating with
> higher poverty rates and greater demand for social safety net programs — a
> factor that historically benefits Democratic candidates.

#### 🎓 Education Levels

Analysis of high school diploma and bachelor's degree attainment across
AZ-07 counties revealed:

- **Maricopa County** leads in bachelor's degree holders, reflecting its
  urban/suburban character
- **Yuma County** has the lowest educational attainment, correlating with its
  agricultural economy and immigrant workforce
- **Pima County** falls in between, anchored by Tucson's university presence

> Lower education levels in Yuma correlate with **economic vulnerability**
> and increased sensitivity to **cost-of-living and wage issues**.

#### 💼 Employment Status

- All three counties show **high employment rates** relative to state averages
- **Yuma County** has the **highest unemployment rate** among the three,
  driven by seasonal agricultural employment patterns
- Maricopa and Pima benefit from diversified economies (tech, defense, healthcare)

> Seasonal unemployment in Yuma makes **job security and agricultural labor
> policy** critical swing factors.

#### 👶 Age Distribution

- Yuma County trends **younger**, consistent with its larger Hispanic
  family demographic
- Maricopa shows a balanced age distribution with significant retiree populations
- Pima has a notable university-age cohort (University of Arizona)

> A younger electorate in Yuma increases the importance of **education
> funding, youth employment, and affordable housing** as campaign issues.

#### 🏥 Poverty & Health Insurance

The poverty choropleth map (from shapefile analysis) revealed:

- **Concentrated poverty pockets** in southern Yuma and parts of rural Pima
- Strong spatial correlation between **high poverty areas and Democratic
  precinct wins**
- Health insurance coverage gaps align with poverty clusters

> Poverty concentration in AZ-07 makes **Medicaid expansion, ACA protections,
> and social welfare programs** electorally significant.

#### 🗺️ Geospatial Patterns

The precinct-level maps revealed:

- **Urban precincts** (Tucson suburbs in Pima, southwest Maricopa) are
  **overwhelmingly Democratic**
- **Rural precincts** (eastern La Paz, rural Pinal) show **pockets of
  Republican support**
- The **border corridor** (Yuma to Santa Cruz) is a **Democratic stronghold**
